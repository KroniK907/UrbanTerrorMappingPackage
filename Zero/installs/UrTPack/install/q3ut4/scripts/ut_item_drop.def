count: sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 0).
gametype : Specifies gametypes for the weapon to be in in. If this key is not used, the weapon will be in all gametypes. List types in this format: 01234
wait : time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay
angle: direction in which model will be oriented.
target : this points to the entity to activate.
targetname : activating trigger points to this.
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
angles : Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
spawnflags : set to 1 to make suspended so the item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor. (default 0)
-------- Notes --------
A count has to be set in order for ammo to be in the weapon when picked up 
the count system is very weird and I am unable to figure out how it works,
but here are some usefull numbers
count of 30   = 30 bullets 0 clips
count of 500  = 30 bullets 1 clip
count of 1000 = 30 bullets 2 clips
